      The Linux USB subsystem has grown from supporting only two different
      types of devices in the 2.2.7 kernel (mice and keyboards), to over 20
      different types of devices in the 2.4 kernel. Linux currently supports
      almost all USB class devices (standard types of devices like keyboards,
      mice, modems, printers and speakers) and an ever-growing number of
      vendor-specific devices (such as USB to serial converters, digital
      cameras, Ethernet devices and MP3 players). For a full list of the
      different USB devices currently supported, see Resources.
  </p><p>
      The remaining kinds of USB devices that do not have support on Linux are
      almost all vendor-specific devices. Each vendor decides to implement a
      custom protocol to talk to their device, so a custom driver usually needs
      to be created. Some vendors are open with their USB protocols and help
      with the creation of Linux drivers, while others do not publish them, and
      developers are forced to reverse-engineer. See Resources for some links
      to handy reverse-engineering tools.
  </p><p>
      Because each different protocol causes a new driver to be created, I have
      written a generic USB driver skeleton, modelled after the pci-skeleton.c
      file in the kernel source tree upon which many PCI network drivers have
      been based. This USB skeleton can be found at drivers/usb/usb-skeleton.c
      in the kernel source tree. In this article I will walk through the basics
      of the skeleton driver, explaining the different pieces and what needs to
      be done to customize it to your specific device.
