The LSM kernel patch provides a general kernel framework to support
security modules.  In particular, the LSM framework is primarily
focused on supporting access control modules, although future
development is likely to address other security needs such as
auditing.  By itself, the framework does not provide any additional
security; it merely provides the infrastructure to support security
modules.  The LSM kernel patch also moves most of the capabilities
logic into an optional security module, with the system defaulting
to the traditional superuser logic.  This capabilities module
is discussed further in <a class="xref" href="cap.html" title="LSM Capabilities Module">the section called “LSM Capabilities Module”</a>.
</p><p>
The LSM kernel patch adds security fields to kernel data structures
and inserts calls to hook functions at critical points in the kernel
code to manage the security fields and to perform access control.  It
also adds functions for registering and unregistering security
modules, and adds a general <code class="function">security</code> system call
to support new system calls for security-aware applications.
</p><p>
The LSM security fields are simply <span class="type">void*</span> pointers.  For
process and program execution security information, security fields
were added to <span class="structname">struct task_struct</span> and 
<span class="structname">struct linux_binprm</span>.  For filesystem security
information, a security field was added to 
<span class="structname">struct super_block</span>.  For pipe, file, and socket
security information, security fields were added to 
<span class="structname">struct inode</span> and 
<span class="structname">struct file</span>.  For packet and network device security
information, security fields were added to
<span class="structname">struct sk_buff</span> and
<span class="structname">struct net_device</span>.  For System V IPC security
information, security fields were added to
<span class="structname">struct kern_ipc_perm</span> and
<span class="structname">struct msg_msg</span>; additionally, the definitions
for <span class="structname">struct msg_msg</span>, <span class="structname">struct 
msg_queue</span>, and <span class="structname">struct 
shmid_kernel</span> were moved to header files
(<code class="filename">include/linux/msg.h</code> and
<code class="filename">include/linux/shm.h</code> as appropriate) to allow
the security modules to use these definitions.
</p><p>
Each LSM hook is a function pointer in a global table,
security_ops. This table is a
<span class="structname">security_operations</span> structure as defined by
<code class="filename">include/linux/security.h</code>.  Detailed documentation
for each hook is included in this header file.  At present, this
structure consists of a collection of substructures that group related
hooks based on the kernel object (e.g. task, inode, file, sk_buff,
etc) as well as some top-level hook function pointers for system
operations.  This structure is likely to be flattened in the future
for performance.  The placement of the hook calls in the kernel code
is described by the "called:" lines in the per-hook documentation in
the header file.  The hook calls can also be easily found in the
kernel code by looking for the string "security_ops-&gt;".

</p><p>
Linus mentioned per-process security hooks in his original remarks as a
possible alternative to global security hooks.  However, if LSM were
to start from the perspective of per-process hooks, then the base
framework would have to deal with how to handle operations that
involve multiple processes (e.g. kill), since each process might have
its own hook for controlling the operation.  This would require a
general mechanism for composing hooks in the base framework.
Additionally, LSM would still need global hooks for operations that
have no process context (e.g. network input operations).
Consequently, LSM provides global security hooks, but a security
module is free to implement per-process hooks (where that makes sense)
by storing a security_ops table in each process' security field and
then invoking these per-process hooks from the global hooks.
The problem of composition is thus deferred to the module.
</p><p>
The global security_ops table is initialized to a set of hook
functions provided by a dummy security module that provides
traditional superuser logic.  A <code class="function">register_security</code>
function (in <code class="filename">security/security.c</code>) is provided to
allow a security module to set security_ops to refer to its own hook
functions, and an <code class="function">unregister_security</code> function is
provided to revert security_ops to the dummy module hooks.  This
mechanism is used to set the primary security module, which is
responsible for making the final decision for each hook.
</p><p>
LSM also provides a simple mechanism for stacking additional security
modules with the primary security module.  It defines
<code class="function">register_security</code> and
<code class="function">unregister_security</code> hooks in the
<span class="structname">security_operations</span> structure and provides
<code class="function">mod_reg_security</code> and
<code class="function">mod_unreg_security</code> functions that invoke these
hooks after performing some sanity checking.  A security module can
call these functions in order to stack with other modules.  However,
the actual details of how this stacking is handled are deferred to the
module, which can implement these hooks in any way it wishes
(including always returning an error if it does not wish to support
stacking).  In this manner, LSM again defers the problem of
composition to the module.
</p><p>
Although the LSM hooks are organized into substructures based on
kernel object, all of the hooks can be viewed as falling into two
major categories: hooks that are used to manage the security fields
and hooks that are used to perform access control.  Examples of the
first category of hooks include the
<code class="function">alloc_security</code> and
<code class="function">free_security</code> hooks defined for each kernel data
structure that has a security field.  These hooks are used to allocate
and free security structures for kernel objects.  The first category
of hooks also includes hooks that set information in the security
field after allocation, such as the <code class="function">post_lookup</code>
hook in <span class="structname">struct inode_security_ops</span>.  This hook
is used to set security information for inodes after successful lookup
operations.  An example of the second category of hooks is the
<code class="function">permission</code> hook in 
<span class="structname">struct inode_security_ops</span>.  This hook checks
permission when accessing an inode.
