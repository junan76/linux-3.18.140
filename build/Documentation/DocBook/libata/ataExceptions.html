  This chapter tries to identify what error/exception conditions exist
  for ATA/ATAPI devices and describe how they should be handled in
  implementation-neutral way.
  </p><p>
  The term 'error' is used to describe conditions where either an
  explicit error condition is reported from device or a command has
  timed out.
  </p><p>
  The term 'exception' is either used to describe exceptional
  conditions which are not errors (say, power or hotplug events), or
  to describe both errors and non-error exceptional conditions.  Where
  explicit distinction between error and exception is necessary, the
  term 'non-error exception' is used.

     Exceptions are described primarily with respect to legacy
     taskfile + bus master IDE interface.  If a controller provides
     other better mechanism for error reporting, mapping those into
     categories described below shouldn't be difficult.
     </p><p>
     In the following sections, two recovery actions - reset and
     reconfiguring transport - are mentioned.  These are described
     further in <a class="xref" href="exrec.html" title="EH recovery actions">the section called “EH recovery actions”</a>.
     </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="excatHSMviolation"></a>HSM violation</h3></div></div></div><p>
        This error is indicated when STATUS value doesn't match HSM
        requirement during issuing or execution any ATA/ATAPI command.
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Examples</b></p><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	ATA_STATUS doesn't contain !BSY &amp;&amp; DRDY &amp;&amp; !DRQ while trying
	to issue a command.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	!BSY &amp;&amp; !DRQ during PIO data transfer.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	!BSY &amp;&amp; ERR after CDB transfer starts but before the
        last byte of CDB is transferred.  ATA/ATAPI standard states
        that "The device shall not terminate the PACKET command
        with an error before the last byte of the command packet has
        been written" in the error outputs description of PACKET
        command and the state diagram doesn't include such
        transitions.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
	In these cases, HSM is violated and not much information
	regarding the error can be acquired from STATUS or ERROR
	register.  IOW, this error can be anything - driver bug,
	faulty device, controller and/or cable.
	</p><p>
	As HSM is violated, reset is necessary to restore known state.
	Reconfiguring transport for lower speed might be helpful too
	as transmission errors sometimes cause this kind of errors.

	These are errors detected and reported by ATA/ATAPI devices
	indicating device problems.  For this type of errors, STATUS
	and ERROR register values are valid and describe error
	condition.  Note that some of ATA bus errors are detected by
	ATA/ATAPI devices and reported using the same mechanism as
	device errors.  Those cases are described later in this
	section.
	</p><p>
	For ATA commands, this type of errors are indicated by !BSY
	&amp;&amp; ERR during command execution and on completion.
	</p><p>For ATAPI commands,</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>

	</p></li></ul></div><p>
	Of errors detected as above, the followings are not ATA/ATAPI
	device errors but ATA bus errors and should be handled
	according to <a class="xref" href="ataExceptions.html#excatATAbusErr" title="ATA bus error">the section called “ATA bus error”</a>.
	</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">CRC error during data transfer</span></dt><dd><p>
	   This is indicated by ICRC bit in the ERROR register and
	   means that corruption occurred during data transfer.  Up to
	   ATA/ATAPI-7, the standard specifies that this bit is only
	   applicable to UDMA transfers but ATA/ATAPI-8 draft revision
	   1f says that the bit may be applicable to multiword DMA and
	   PIO.
	   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">ABRT error during data transfer or on completion</span></dt><dd><p>
	   Up to ATA/ATAPI-7, the standard specifies that ABRT could be
	   set on ICRC errors and on cases where a device is not able
	   to complete a command.  Combined with the fact that MWDMA
	   and PIO transfer errors aren't allowed to use ICRC bit up to
	   ATA/ATAPI-7, it seems to imply that ABRT bit alone could
	   indicate transfer errors.
	   </p><p>
	   However, ATA/ATAPI-8 draft revision 1f removes the part
	   that ICRC errors can turn on ABRT.  So, this is kind of
	   gray area.  Some heuristics are needed here.
	   </p></dd></dl></div><p>
	ATA/ATAPI device errors can be further categorized as follows.
	</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Media errors</span></dt><dd><p>
	   This is indicated by UNC bit in the ERROR register.  ATA
	   devices reports UNC error only after certain number of
	   retries cannot recover the data, so there's nothing much
	   else to do other than notifying upper layer.
	   </p><p>
	   READ and WRITE commands report CHS or LBA of the first
	   failed sector but ATA/ATAPI standard specifies that the
	   amount of transferred data on error completion is
	   indeterminate, so we cannot assume that sectors preceding
	   the failed sector have been transferred and thus cannot
	   complete those sectors successfully as SCSI does.

	   This can be invalid command or parameter indicated by ABRT
	   ERROR bit or some other error condition.  Note that ABRT
	   bit can indicate a lot of things including ICRC and Address
	   errors.  Heuristics needed.
	   </p></dd></dl></div><p>
	Depending on commands, not all STATUS/ERROR bits are
	applicable.  These non-applicable bits are marked with
	"na" in the output descriptions but up to ATA/ATAPI-7
	no definition of "na" can be found.  However,
	ATA/ATAPI-8 draft revision 1f describes "N/A" as
	follows.
	</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">3.2.3.3a N/A</span></dt><dd><p>
	   A keyword the indicates a field has no defined value in
	   this standard and should not be checked by the host or
	   device. N/A fields should be cleared to zero.
	   </p></dd></dl></div></blockquote></div><p>
	So, it seems reasonable to assume that "na" bits are
	cleared to zero by devices and thus need no explicit masking.
	</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="excatATAPIcc"></a>ATAPI device CHECK CONDITION</h3></div></div></div><p>
	ATAPI device CHECK CONDITION error is indicated by set CHK bit
	(ERR bit) in the STATUS register after the last byte of CDB is
	transferred for a PACKET command.  For this kind of errors,
	sense data should be acquired to gather information regarding
	the errors.  REQUEST SENSE packet command should be used to
	acquire sense data.
	</p><p>
	Once sense data is acquired, this type of errors can be
	handled similarly to other SCSI errors.  Note that sense data
	may indicate ATA bus error (e.g. Sense Key 04h HARDWARE ERROR
	&amp;&amp; ASC/ASCQ 47h/00h SCSI PARITY ERROR).  In such
	cases, the error should be considered as an ATA bus error and
	handled according to <a class="xref" href="ataExceptions.html#excatATAbusErr" title="ATA bus error">the section called “ATA bus error”</a>.
	</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="excatNCQerr"></a>ATA device error (NCQ)</h3></div></div></div><p>
	NCQ command error is indicated by cleared BSY and set ERR bit
	during NCQ command phase (one or more NCQ commands
	outstanding).  Although STATUS and ERROR registers will
	contain valid values describing the error, READ LOG EXT is
	required to clear the error condition, determine which command
	has failed and acquire more information.
	</p><p>
	READ LOG EXT Log Page 10h reports which tag has failed and
	taskfile register values describing the error.  With this
	information the failed command can be handled as a normal ATA
	command error as in <a class="xref" href="ataExceptions.html#excatDevErr" title="ATA/ATAPI device error (non-NCQ / non-CHECK CONDITION)">the section called “ATA/ATAPI device error (non-NCQ / non-CHECK CONDITION)”</a> and all
	other in-flight commands must be retried.  Note that this
	retry should not be counted - it's likely that commands
	retried this way would have completed normally if it were not
	for the failed command.
	</p><p>
	Note that ATA bus errors can be reported as ATA device NCQ
	errors.  This should be handled as described in <a class="xref" href="ataExceptions.html#excatATAbusErr" title="ATA bus error">the section called “ATA bus error”</a>.
	</p><p>
	If READ LOG EXT Log Page 10h fails or reports NQ, we're
	thoroughly screwed.  This condition should be treated
	according to <a class="xref" href="ataExceptions.html#excatHSMviolation" title="HSM violation">the section called “HSM violation”</a>.
	</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="excatATAbusErr"></a>ATA bus error</h3></div></div></div><p>
	ATA bus error means that data corruption occurred during
	transmission over ATA bus (SATA or PATA).  This type of errors
	can be indicated by
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	ICRC or ABRT error as described in <a class="xref" href="ataExceptions.html#excatDevErr" title="ATA/ATAPI device error (non-NCQ / non-CHECK CONDITION)">the section called “ATA/ATAPI device error (non-NCQ / non-CHECK CONDITION)”</a>.

	Unknown/random errors, timeouts and all sorts of weirdities.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
	As described above, transmission errors can cause wide variety
	of symptoms ranging from device ICRC error to random device
	lockup, and, for many cases, there is no way to tell if an
	error condition is due to transmission error or not;
	therefore, it's necessary to employ some kind of heuristic
	when dealing with errors and timeouts.  For example,
	encountering repetitive ABRT errors for known supported
	command is likely to indicate ATA bus error.
	</p><p>
	Once it's determined that ATA bus errors have possibly
	occurred, lowering ATA bus transmission speed is one of
	actions which may alleviate the problem.  See <a class="xref" href="exrec.html#exrecReconf" title="Reconfigure transport">the section called “Reconfigure transport”</a> for more information.

	Data corruption or other failures during transmission over PCI
	(or other system bus).  For standard BMDMA, this is indicated
	by Error bit in the BMDMA Status register.  This type of
	errors must be logged as it indicates something is very wrong
	with the system.  Resetting host controller is recommended.
	</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="excatLateCompletion"></a>Late completion</h3></div></div></div><p>
	This occurs when timeout occurs and the timeout handler finds
	out that the timed out command has completed successfully or
	with error.  This is usually caused by lost interrupts.  This
	type of errors must be logged.  Resetting host controller is
	recommended.
	</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="excatUnknown"></a>Unknown error (timeout)</h3></div></div></div><p>
	This is when timeout occurs and the command is still
	processing or the host and device are in unknown state.  When
	this occurs, HSM could be in any valid or invalid state.  To
	bring the device to known state and make it forget about the
	timed out command, resetting is necessary.  The timed out
	command may be retried.
	</p><p>
	Timeouts can also be caused by transmission errors.  Refer to
