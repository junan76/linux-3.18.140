     This section discusses several important recovery actions.
     </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="exrecClr"></a>Clearing error condition</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Many controllers require its error registers to be cleared by
	error handler.  Different controllers may have different
	requirements.
	</p><p>
	For SATA, it's strongly recommended to clear at least SError
	register during error handling.
	</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="exrecRst"></a>Reset</h3></div></div></div><p>
	During EH, resetting is necessary in the following cases.
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	HSM is in unknown or invalid state
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	HBA is in unknown or invalid state
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	EH needs to make HBA/device forget about in-flight commands
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	HBA/device behaves weirdly
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
	Resetting during EH might be a good idea regardless of error
	condition to improve EH robustness.  Whether to reset both or
	either one of HBA and device depends on situation but the
	following scheme is recommended.
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	When it's known that HBA is in ready state but ATA/ATAPI
	device is in unknown state, reset only device.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	If HBA is in unknown state, reset both HBA and device.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
	HBA resetting is implementation specific.  For a controller
	complying to taskfile/BMDMA PCI IDE, stopping active DMA
	transaction may be sufficient iff BMDMA state is the only HBA
	context.  But even mostly taskfile/BMDMA PCI IDE complying
	controllers may have implementation specific requirements and
	mechanism to reset themselves.  This must be addressed by
	specific drivers.
	</p><p>
	OTOH, ATA/ATAPI standard describes in detail ways to reset
	ATA/ATAPI devices.
	</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">PATA hardware reset</span></dt><dd><p>
	   This is hardware initiated device reset signalled with
	   asserted PATA RESET- signal.  There is no standard way to
	   initiate hardware reset from software although some
	   hardware provides registers that allow driver to directly
	   tweak the RESET- signal.
	   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Software reset</span></dt><dd><p>
	   This is achieved by turning CONTROL SRST bit on for at
	   least 5us.  Both PATA and SATA support it but, in case of
	   SATA, this may require controller-specific support as the
	   second Register FIS to clear SRST should be transmitted
	   while BSY bit is still set.  Note that on PATA, this resets
	   both master and slave devices on a channel.
	   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">EXECUTE DEVICE DIAGNOSTIC command</span></dt><dd><p>
	   Although ATA/ATAPI standard doesn't describe exactly, EDD
	   implies some level of resetting, possibly similar level
	   with software reset.  Host-side EDD protocol can be handled
	   with normal command processing and most SATA controllers
	   should be able to handle EDD's just like other commands.
	   As in software reset, EDD affects both devices on a PATA
	   bus.
	   </p><p>
	   Although EDD does reset devices, this doesn't suit error
	   handling as EDD cannot be issued while BSY is set and it's
	   unclear how it will act when device is in unknown/weird
	   state.
	   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">ATAPI DEVICE RESET command</span></dt><dd><p>
	   This is very similar to software reset except that reset
	   can be restricted to the selected device without affecting
	   the other device sharing the cable.
	   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">SATA phy reset</span></dt><dd><p>
	   This is the preferred way of resetting a SATA device.  In
	   effect, it's identical to PATA hardware reset.  Note that
	   this can be done with the standard SCR Control register.
	   As such, it's usually easier to implement than software
	   reset.
	   </p></dd></dl></div><p>
	One more thing to consider when resetting devices is that
	resetting clears certain configuration parameters and they
	need to be set to their previous or newly adjusted values
	after reset.
	</p><p>
	Parameters affected are.
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	CHS set up with INITIALIZE DEVICE PARAMETERS (seldom used)
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Parameters set with SET FEATURES including transfer mode setting
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Block count set with SET MULTIPLE MODE
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Other parameters (SET MAX, MEDIA LOCK...)
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
	ATA/ATAPI standard specifies that some parameters must be
	maintained across hardware or software reset, but doesn't
	strictly specify all of them.  Always reconfiguring needed
	parameters after reset is required for robustness.  Note that
	this also applies when resuming from deep sleep (power-off).
	</p><p>
	Also, ATA/ATAPI standard requires that IDENTIFY DEVICE /
	IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE is issued after any configuration
	parameter is updated or a hardware reset and the result used
	for further operation.  OS driver is required to implement
	revalidation mechanism to support this.
	</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="exrecReconf"></a>Reconfigure transport</h3></div></div></div><p>
	For both PATA and SATA, a lot of corners are cut for cheap
	connectors, cables or controllers and it's quite common to see
	high transmission error rate.  This can be mitigated by
	lowering transmission speed.
	</p><p>
	The following is a possible scheme Jeff Garzik suggested.
	</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
	If more than $N (3?) transmission errors happen in 15 minutes,
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	if SATA, decrease SATA PHY speed.  if speed cannot be decreased,
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	decrease UDMA xfer speed.  if at UDMA0, switch to PIO4,
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	decrease PIO xfer speed.  if at PIO3, complain, but continue
	</p></li></ul></div></blockquote></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ataExceptions.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ataExceptions.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="PiixInt.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 7. ATA errors and exceptions </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 8. ata_piix Internals</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
