   mac80211 has support for various powersave implementations.
   </p><p>
   First, it can support hardware that handles all powersaving by itself,
   such hardware should simply set the <code class="constant">IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS</code> hardware
   flag. In that case, it will be told about the desired powersave mode
   with the <code class="constant">IEEE80211_CONF_PS</code> flag depending on the association status.
   The hardware must take care of sending nullfunc frames when necessary,
   i.e. when entering and leaving powersave mode. The hardware is required
   to look at the AID in beacons and signal to the AP that it woke up when
   it finds traffic directed to it.
   </p><p>
   <code class="constant">IEEE80211_CONF_PS</code> flag enabled means that the powersave mode defined in
   IEEE 802.11-2007 section 11.2 is enabled. This is not to be confused
   with hardware wakeup and sleep states. Driver is responsible for waking
   up the hardware before issuing commands to the hardware and putting it
   back to sleep at appropriate times.
   </p><p>
   When PS is enabled, hardware needs to wakeup for beacons and receive the
   buffered multicast/broadcast frames after the beacon. Also it must be
   possible to send frames and receive the acknowledment frame.
   </p><p>
   Other hardware designs cannot send nullfunc frames by themselves and also
   need software support for parsing the TIM bitmap. This is also supported
   by mac80211 by combining the <code class="constant">IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS</code> and
   <code class="constant">IEEE80211_HW_PS_NULLFUNC_STACK</code> flags. The hardware is of course still
   required to pass up beacons. The hardware is still required to handle
   waking up for multicast traffic; if it cannot the driver must handle that
   as best as it can, mac80211 is too slow to do that.
   </p><p>
   Dynamic powersave is an extension to normal powersave in which the
   hardware stays awake for a user-specified period of time after sending a
   frame so that reply frames need not be buffered and therefore delayed to
   the next wakeup. It's compromise of getting good enough latency when
   there's data traffic and still saving significantly power in idle
   periods.
   </p><p>
   Dynamic powersave is simply supported by mac80211 enabling and disabling
   PS based on traffic. Driver needs to only set <code class="constant">IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS</code>
   flag and mac80211 will handle everything automatically. Additionally,
   hardware having support for the dynamic PS feature may set the
   <code class="constant">IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_DYNAMIC_PS</code> flag to indicate that it can support
   dynamic PS mode itself. The driver needs to look at the
   <em class="parameter"><code>dynamic_ps_timeout</code></em> hardware configuration value and use it that value
   whenever <code class="constant">IEEE80211_CONF_PS</code> is set. In this case mac80211 will disable
   dynamic PS feature in stack and will just keep <code class="constant">IEEE80211_CONF_PS</code>
   enabled whenever user has enabled powersave.
   </p><p>
   Driver informs U-APSD client support by enabling
   <code class="constant">IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_UAPSD</code> flag. The mode is configured through the
   uapsd parameter in <code class="function">conf_tx</code> operation. Hardware needs to send the QoS
   Nullfunc frames and stay awake until the service period has ended. To
   utilize U-APSD, dynamic powersave is disabled for voip AC and all frames
   from that AC are transmitted with powersave enabled.
   </p><p>
   Note: U-APSD client mode is not yet supported with
   <code class="constant">IEEE80211_HW_PS_NULLFUNC_STACK</code>.
