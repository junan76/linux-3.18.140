</p><pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;linux/usb.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/usbdevice_fs.h&gt;
#include &lt;asm/byteorder.h&gt;</pre><p>
	    The standard USB device model requests, from "Chapter 9" of
	    the USB 2.0 specification, are automatically included from
	    the <code class="filename">&lt;linux/usb/ch9.h&gt;</code> header.
	    </p><p>Unless noted otherwise, the ioctl requests
	    described here will
	    update the modification time on the usbfs file to which
	    they are applied (unless they fail).
	    A return of zero indicates success; otherwise, a
	    standard USB error code is returned.  (These are
	    documented in
	    <code class="filename">Documentation/usb/error-codes.txt</code>
	    in your kernel sources.)
	    </p><p>Each of these files multiplexes access to several
	    I/O streams, one per endpoint.
	    Each device has one control endpoint (endpoint zero)
	    which supports a limited RPC style RPC access.
	    Devices are configured
	    by hub_wq (in the kernel) setting a device-wide
	    <span class="emphasis"><em>configuration</em></span> that affects things
	    like power consumption and basic functionality.
	    The endpoints are part of USB <span class="emphasis"><em>interfaces</em></span>,
	    which may have <span class="emphasis"><em>altsettings</em></span>
	    affecting things like which endpoints are available.
	    Many devices only have a single configuration and interface,
	    so drivers for them will ignore configurations and altsettings.
