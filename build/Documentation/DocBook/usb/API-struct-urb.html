   This structure identifies USB transfer requests.  URBs must be allocated by
   calling <code class="function">usb_alloc_urb</code> and freed with a call to <code class="function">usb_free_urb</code>.
   Initialization may be done using various usb_fill_*<code class="function">_urb</code> functions.  URBs
   are submitted using <code class="function">usb_submit_urb</code>, and pending requests may be canceled
   using <code class="function">usb_unlink_urb</code> or <code class="function">usb_kill_urb</code>.
</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="idm1556"></a><h2>Data Transfer Buffers</h2><p>
   </p><p>

   Normally drivers provide I/O buffers allocated with <code class="function">kmalloc</code> or otherwise
   taken from the general page pool.  That is provided by transfer_buffer
   (control requests also use setup_packet), and host controller drivers
   perform a dma mapping (and unmapping) for each buffer transferred.  Those
   mapping operations can be expensive on some platforms (perhaps using a dma
   bounce buffer or talking to an IOMMU),
   although they're cheap on commodity x86 and ppc hardware.
   </p><p>

   Alternatively, drivers may pass the URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP transfer flag,
   which tells the host controller driver that no such mapping is needed for
   the transfer_buffer since
   the device driver is DMA-aware.  For example, a device driver might
   allocate a DMA buffer with <code class="function">usb_alloc_coherent</code> or call <code class="function">usb_buffer_map</code>.
   When this transfer flag is provided, host controller drivers will
   attempt to use the dma address found in the transfer_dma
   field rather than determining a dma address themselves.
   </p><p>

   Note that transfer_buffer must still be set if the controller
   does not support DMA (as indicated by bus.uses_dma) and when talking
   to root hub. If you have to trasfer between highmem zone and the device
   on such controller, create a bounce buffer or bail out with an error.
   If transfer_buffer cannot be set (is in highmem) and the controller is DMA
   capable, assign NULL to it, so that usbmon knows not to use the value.
   The setup_packet must always be set, so it cannot be located in highmem.
</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="idm1565"></a><h2>Initialization</h2><p>
   </p><p>

   All URBs submitted must initialize the dev, pipe, transfer_flags (may be
   zero), and complete fields.  All URBs must also initialize
   transfer_buffer and transfer_buffer_length.  They may provide the
   URB_SHORT_NOT_OK transfer flag, indicating that short reads are
   to be treated as errors; that flag is invalid for write requests.
   </p><p>

   Bulk URBs may
   use the URB_ZERO_PACKET transfer flag, indicating that bulk OUT transfers
   should always terminate with a short packet, even if it means adding an
   extra zero length packet.
   </p><p>

   Control URBs must provide a valid pointer in the setup_packet field.
   Unlike the transfer_buffer, the setup_packet may not be mapped for DMA
   beforehand.
   </p><p>

   Interrupt URBs must provide an interval, saying how often (in milliseconds
   or, for highspeed devices, 125 microsecond units)
   to poll for transfers.  After the URB has been submitted, the interval
   field reflects how the transfer was actually scheduled.
   The polling interval may be more frequent than requested.
   For example, some controllers have a maximum interval of 32 milliseconds,
   while others support intervals of up to 1024 milliseconds.
   Isochronous URBs also have transfer intervals.  (Note that for isochronous
   endpoints, as well as high speed interrupt endpoints, the encoding of
   the transfer interval in the endpoint descriptor is logarithmic.
   Device drivers must convert that value to linear units themselves.)
   </p><p>

   If an isochronous endpoint queue isn't already running, the host
   controller will schedule a new URB to start as soon as bandwidth
   utilization allows.  If the queue is running then a new URB will be
   scheduled to start in the first transfer slot following the end of the
   preceding URB, if that slot has not already expired.  If the slot has
   expired (which can happen when IRQ delivery is delayed for a long time),
   the scheduling behavior depends on the URB_ISO_ASAP flag.  If the flag
   is clear then the URB will be scheduled to start in the expired slot,
   implying that some of its packets will not be transferred; if the flag
   is set then the URB will be scheduled in the first unexpired slot,
   breaking the queue's synchronization.  Upon URB completion, the
   start_frame field will be set to the (micro)frame number in which the
   transfer was scheduled.  Ranges for frame counter values are HC-specific
   and can go from as low as 256 to as high as 65536 frames.
   </p><p>

   Isochronous URBs have a different data transfer model, in part because
   the quality of service is only <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">best effort</span>”</span>.  Callers provide specially
   allocated URBs, with number_of_packets worth of iso_frame_desc structures
   at the end.  Each such packet is an individual ISO transfer.  Isochronous
   URBs are normally queued, submitted by drivers to arrange that
   transfers are at least double buffered, and then explicitly resubmitted
   in completion handlers, so
   that data (such as audio or video) streams at as constant a rate as the
   host controller scheduler can support.
</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="idm1575"></a><h2>Completion Callbacks</h2><p>
   </p><p>

   The completion callback is made <code class="function">in_interrupt</code>, and one of the first
   things that a completion handler should do is check the status field.
   The status field is provided for all URBs.  It is used to report
   unlinked URBs, and status for all non-ISO transfers.  It should not
   be examined before the URB is returned to the completion handler.
   </p><p>

   The context field is normally used to link URBs back to the relevant
   driver or request state.
   </p><p>

   When the completion callback is invoked for non-isochronous URBs, the
   actual_length field tells how many bytes were transferred.  This field
   is updated even when the URB terminated with an error or was unlinked.
   </p><p>

   ISO transfer status is reported in the status and actual_length fields
   of the iso_frame_desc array, and the number of errors is reported in
   error_count.  Completion callbacks for ISO transfers will normally
   (re)submit URBs to ensure a constant transfer rate.
   </p><p>

   Note that even fields marked <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">public</span>”</span> should not be touched by the driver
   when the urb is owned by the hcd, that is, since the call to
   <code class="function">usb_submit_urb</code> till the entry into the completion routine.
