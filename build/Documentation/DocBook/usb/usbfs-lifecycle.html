	    for a device it knows how to handle.
	    Maybe it was told about it because a
	    <code class="filename">/sbin/hotplug</code> event handling agent
	    chose that driver to handle the new device.
	    Or maybe it's an application that scans all the
	    /proc/bus/usb device files, and ignores most devices.
	    In either case, it should <code class="function">read()</code> all
	    the descriptors from the device file,
	    and check them against what it knows how to handle.
	    It might just reject everything except a particular
	    vendor and product ID, or need a more complex policy.
	    </p><p>Never assume there will only be one such device
	    on the system at a time!
	    If your code can't handle more than one device at
	    a time, at least detect when there's more than one, and
	    have your users choose which device to use.
	    </p><p>Once your user mode driver knows what device to use,
	    it interacts with it in either of two styles.
	    The simple style is to make only control requests; some
	    devices don't need more complex interactions than those.
	    (An example might be software using vendor-specific control
	    requests for some initialization or configuration tasks,
	    with a kernel driver for the rest.)
	    </p><p>More likely, you need a more complex style driver:
	    one using non-control endpoints, reading or writing data
	    and claiming exclusive use of an interface.
	    <span class="emphasis"><em>Bulk</em></span> transfers are easiest to use,
	    but only their sibling <span class="emphasis"><em>interrupt</em></span> transfers 
	    work with low speed devices.
	    Both interrupt and <span class="emphasis"><em>isochronous</em></span> transfers
	    offer service guarantees because their bandwidth is reserved.
	    Such "periodic" transfers are awkward to use through usbfs,
	    unless you're using the asynchronous calls.  However, interrupt
	    transfers can also be used in a synchronous "one shot" style.
	    </p><p>Your user-mode driver should never need to worry
	    about cleaning up request state when the device is
	    disconnected, although it should close its open file
	    descriptors as soon as it starts seeing the ENODEV
	    errors.
