   This routine cancels an in-progress request.  URBs complete only once
   per submission, and may be canceled only once per submission.
   Successful cancellation means termination of <em class="parameter"><code>urb</code></em> will be expedited
   and the completion handler will be called with a status code
   indicating that the request has been canceled (rather than any other
   code).
   </p><p>

   Drivers should not call this routine or related routines, such as
   <code class="function">usb_kill_urb</code> or <code class="function">usb_unlink_anchored_urbs</code>, after their disconnect
   method has returned.  The disconnect function should synchronize with
   a driver's I/O routines to insure that all URB-related activity has
   completed before it returns.
   </p><p>

   This request is asynchronous, however the HCD might call the -&gt;<code class="function">complete</code>
   callback during unlink. Therefore when drivers call <code class="function">usb_unlink_urb</code>, they
   must not hold any locks that may be taken by the completion function.
   Success is indicated by returning -EINPROGRESS, at which time the URB will
   probably not yet have been given back to the device driver. When it is
   eventually called, the completion function will see <em class="parameter"><code>urb</code></em>-&gt;status ==
   -ECONNRESET.
   Failure is indicated by <code class="function">usb_unlink_urb</code> returning any other value.
   Unlinking will fail when <em class="parameter"><code>urb</code></em> is not currently <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">linked</span>”</span> (i.e., it was
   never submitted, or it was unlinked before, or the hardware is already
   finished with it), even if the completion handler has not yet run.
   </p><p>

   The URB must not be deallocated while this routine is running.  In
   particular, when a driver calls this routine, it must insure that the
   completion handler cannot deallocate the URB.

   -EINPROGRESS on success. See description for other values on
   failure.
</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="idm2277"></a><h2>Unlinking and Endpoint Queues</h2><p>
   </p><p>

   [The behaviors and guarantees described below do not apply to virtual
   root hubs but only to endpoint queues for physical USB devices.]
   </p><p>

   Host Controller Drivers (HCDs) place all the URBs for a particular
   endpoint in a queue.  Normally the queue advances as the controller
   hardware processes each request.  But when an URB terminates with an
   error its queue generally stops (see below), at least until that URB's
   completion routine returns.  It is guaranteed that a stopped queue
   will not restart until all its unlinked URBs have been fully retired,
   with their completion routines run, even if that's not until some time
   after the original completion handler returns.  The same behavior and
   guarantee apply when an URB terminates because it was unlinked.
   </p><p>

   Bulk and interrupt endpoint queues are guaranteed to stop whenever an
   URB terminates with any sort of error, including -ECONNRESET, -ENOENT,
   and -EREMOTEIO.  Control endpoint queues behave the same way except
   that they are not guaranteed to stop for -EREMOTEIO errors.  Queues
   for isochronous endpoints are treated differently, because they must
   advance at fixed rates.  Such queues do not stop when an URB
   encounters an error or is unlinked.  An unlinked isochronous URB may
   leave a gap in the stream of packets; it is undefined whether such
   gaps can be filled in.
   </p><p>

   Note that early termination of an URB because a short packet was
   received will generate a -EREMOTEIO error if and only if the
   URB_SHORT_NOT_OK flag is set.  By setting this flag, USB device
   drivers can build deep queues for large or complex bulk transfers
   and clean them up reliably after any sort of aborted transfer by
   unlinking all pending URBs at the first fault.
   </p><p>

   When a control URB terminates with an error other than -EREMOTEIO, it
   is quite likely that the status stage of the transfer will not take
   place.
