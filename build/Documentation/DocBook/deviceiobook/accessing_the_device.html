	The part of the interface most used by drivers is reading and
	writing memory-mapped registers on the device.	Linux provides
	interfaces to read and write 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit
	quantities.  Due to a historical accident, these are named byte,
	word, long and quad accesses.  Both read and write accesses are
	supported; there is no prefetch support at this time.
      </p><p>
	The functions are named <code class="function">readb</code>,
	<code class="function">readw</code>, <code class="function">readl</code>,
	<code class="function">readq</code>, <code class="function">readb_relaxed</code>,
	<code class="function">readw_relaxed</code>, <code class="function">readl_relaxed</code>,
	<code class="function">readq_relaxed</code>, <code class="function">writeb</code>,
	<code class="function">writew</code>, <code class="function">writel</code> and
	<code class="function">writeq</code>.
      </p><p>
	Some devices (such as framebuffers) would like to use larger
	transfers than 8 bytes at a time.  For these devices, the
	<code class="function">memcpy_toio</code>, <code class="function">memcpy_fromio</code>
	and <code class="function">memset_io</code> functions are provided.
	Do not use memset or memcpy on IO addresses; they
	are not guaranteed to copy data in order.
      </p><p>
	The read and write functions are defined to be ordered. That is the
	compiler is not permitted to reorder the I/O sequence. When the 
	ordering can be compiler optimised, you can use <code class="function">
	__readb</code> and friends to indicate the relaxed ordering. Use 
	this with care.
      </p><p>
	While the basic functions are defined to be synchronous with respect
	to each other and ordered with respect to each other the busses the
	devices sit on may themselves have asynchronicity. In particular many
	authors are burned by the fact that PCI bus writes are posted
	asynchronously. A driver author must issue a read from the same
	device to ensure that writes have occurred in the specific cases the
	author cares. This kind of property cannot be hidden from driver
	writers in the API.  In some cases, the read used to flush the device
	may be expected to fail (if the card is resetting, for example).  In
	that case, the read should be done from config space, which is
	guaranteed to soft-fail if the card doesn't respond.
      </p><p>
	The following is an example of flushing a write to a device when
	the driver would like to ensure the write's effects are visible prior
	to continuing execution.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
static inline void
qla1280_disable_intrs(struct scsi_qla_host *ha)
{
	struct device_reg *reg;

	reg = ha-&gt;iobase;
	/* disable risc and host interrupts */
	WRT_REG_WORD(&amp;reg-&gt;ictrl, 0);
	/*
	 * The following read will ensure that the above write
	 * has been received by the device before we return from this
	 * function.
	 */
	RD_REG_WORD(&amp;reg-&gt;ictrl);
	ha-&gt;flags.ints_enabled = 0;
}
</pre><p>
	In addition to write posting, on some large multiprocessing systems
	(e.g. SGI Challenge, Origin and Altix machines) posted writes won't
	be strongly ordered coming from different CPUs.  Thus it's important
	to properly protect parts of your driver that do memory-mapped writes
	with locks and use the <code class="function">mmiowb</code> to make sure they
	arrive in the order intended.  Issuing a regular <code class="function">readX
	</code> will also ensure write ordering, but should only be used
	when the driver has to be sure that the write has actually arrived
	at the device (not that it's simply ordered with respect to other
	writes), since a full <code class="function">readX</code> is a relatively
	expensive operation.
      </p><p>
	Generally, one should use <code class="function">mmiowb</code> prior to
	releasing a spinlock that protects regions using <code class="function">writeb
	</code> or similar functions that aren't surrounded by <code class="function">
	readb</code> calls, which will ensure ordering and flushing.  The
	following pseudocode illustrates what might occur if write ordering
	isn't guaranteed via <code class="function">mmiowb</code> or one of the
	<code class="function">readX</code> functions.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
CPU A:  spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;dev_lock, flags)
CPU A:  ...
CPU A:  writel(newval, ring_ptr);
CPU A:  spin_unlock_irqrestore(&amp;dev_lock, flags)
        ...
CPU B:  spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;dev_lock, flags)
CPU B:  writel(newval2, ring_ptr);
CPU B:  ...
CPU B:  spin_unlock_irqrestore(&amp;dev_lock, flags)
</pre><p>
	In the case above, newval2 could be written to ring_ptr before
	newval.  Fixing it is easy though:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
CPU A:  spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;dev_lock, flags)
CPU A:  ...
CPU A:  writel(newval, ring_ptr);
CPU A:  mmiowb(); /* ensure no other writes beat us to the device */
CPU A:  spin_unlock_irqrestore(&amp;dev_lock, flags)
        ...
CPU B:  spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;dev_lock, flags)
CPU B:  writel(newval2, ring_ptr);
CPU B:  ...
CPU B:  mmiowb();
CPU B:  spin_unlock_irqrestore(&amp;dev_lock, flags)
</pre><p>
	See tg3.c for a real world example of how to use <code class="function">mmiowb
	</code>
      </p><p>
	PCI ordering rules also guarantee that PIO read responses arrive
	after any outstanding DMA writes from that bus, since for some devices
	the result of a <code class="function">readb</code> call may signal to the
	driver that a DMA transaction is complete.  In many cases, however,
	the driver may want to indicate that the next
	<code class="function">readb</code> call has no relation to any previous DMA
	writes performed by the device.  The driver can use
	<code class="function">readb_relaxed</code> for these cases, although only
	some platforms will honor the relaxed semantics.  Using the relaxed
	read functions will provide significant performance benefits on
	platforms that support it.  The qla2xxx driver provides examples
	of how to use <code class="function">readX_relaxed</code>.  In many cases,
	a majority of the driver's <code class="function">readX</code> calls can
	safely be converted to <code class="function">readX_relaxed</code> calls, since
	only a few will indicate or depend on DMA completion.
