	The Z85230 driver provides the back end interface to your board. To
	configure a Z8530 interface you need to detect the board and to 
	identify its ports and interrupt resources. It is also your problem
	to verify the resources are available.
  </p><p>
	Having identified the chip you need to fill in a struct z8530_dev,
	which describes each chip. This object must exist until you finally
	shutdown the board. Firstly zero the active field. This ensures 
	nothing goes off without you intending it. The irq field should
	be set to the interrupt number of the chip. (Each chip has a single
	interrupt source rather than each channel). You are responsible
	for allocating the interrupt line. The interrupt handler should be
	set to <code class="function">z8530_interrupt</code>. The device id should
	be set to the z8530_dev structure pointer. Whether the interrupt can
	be shared or not is board dependent, and up to you to initialise.
  </p><p>
	The structure holds two channel structures. 
	Initialise chanA.ctrlio and chanA.dataio with the address of the
	control and data ports. You can or this with Z8530_PORT_SLEEP to
	indicate your interface needs the 5uS delay for chip settling done
	in software. The PORT_SLEEP option is architecture specific. Other
	flags may become available on future platforms, eg for MMIO.
	Initialise the chanA.irqs to &amp;z8530_nop to start the chip up
	as disabled and discarding interrupt events. This ensures that
	stray interrupts will be mopped up and not hang the bus. Set
	chanA.dev to point to the device structure itself. The
	private and name field you may use as you wish. The private field
	is unused by the Z85230 layer. The name is used for error reporting
	and it may thus make sense to make it match the network name.
  </p><p>
	Repeat the same operation with the B channel if your chip has
	both channels wired to something useful. This isn't always the
	case. If it is not wired then the I/O values do not matter, but
	you must initialise chanB.dev.
  </p><p>
	If your board has DMA facilities then initialise the txdma and
	rxdma fields for the relevant channels. You must also allocate the
	ISA DMA channels and do any necessary board level initialisation
	to configure them. The low level driver will do the Z8530 and
	DMA controller programming but not board specific magic.
  </p><p>
	Having initialised the device you can then call
	<code class="function">z8530_init</code>. This will probe the chip and 
	reset it into a known state. An identification sequence is then
	run to identify the chip type. If the checks fail to pass the
	function returns a non zero error code. Typically this indicates
	that the port given is not valid. After this call the
	type field of the z8530_dev structure is initialised to either
	Z8530, Z85C30 or Z85230 according to the chip found.
  </p><p>
	Once you have called z8530_init you can also make use of the utility
	function <code class="function">z8530_describe</code>. This provides a 
	consistent reporting format for the Z8530 devices, and allows all
	the drivers to provide consistent reporting.
