	The Z85230 driver provides helper functions and tables to load the
	port registers on the Z8530 chips. When programming the register
	settings for a channel be aware that the documentation recommends
	initialisation orders. Strange things happen when these are not
	followed. 
  </p><p>
	<code class="function">z8530_channel_load</code> takes an array of
	pairs of initialisation values in an array of u8 type. The first
	value is the Z8530 register number. Add 16 to indicate the alternate
	register bank on the later chips. The array is terminated by a 255.
  </p><p>
	The driver provides a pair of public tables. The
	z8530_hdlc_kilostream table is for the UK 'Kilostream' service and
	also happens to cover most other end host configurations. The
	z8530_hdlc_kilostream_85230 table is the same configuration using
	the enhancements of the 85230 chip. The configuration loaded is
	standard NRZ encoded synchronous data with HDLC bitstuffing. All
	of the timing is taken from the other end of the link.
  </p><p>
	When writing your own tables be aware that the driver internally
	tracks register values. It may need to reload values. You should
	therefore be sure to set registers 1-7, 9-11, 14 and 15 in all
	configurations. Where the register settings depend on DMA selection
	the driver will update the bits itself when you open or close.
	Loading a new table with the interface open is not recommended.
  </p><p>
	There are three standard configurations supported by the core
	code. In PIO mode the interface is programmed up to use
	interrupt driven PIO. This places high demands on the host processor
	to avoid latency. The driver is written to take account of latency
	issues but it cannot avoid latencies caused by other drivers,
	notably IDE in PIO mode. Because the drivers allocate buffers you
	must also prevent MTU changes while the port is open.
  </p><p>
	Once the port is open it will call the rx_function of each channel
	whenever a completed packet arrived. This is invoked from
	interrupt context and passes you the channel and a network	
	buffer (struct sk_buff) holding the data. The data includes
	the CRC bytes so most users will want to trim the last two
	bytes before processing the data. This function is very timing
	critical. When you wish to simply discard data the support
	code provides the function <code class="function">z8530_null_rx</code>
	to discard the data.
  </p><p>
	To active PIO mode sending and receiving the <code class="function">
	z8530_sync_open</code> is called. This expects to be passed
	the network device and the channel. Typically this is called from
	your network device open callback. On a failure a non zero error
	status is returned. The <code class="function">z8530_sync_close</code> 
	function shuts down a PIO channel. This must be done before the 
	channel is opened again	and before the driver shuts down 
	and unloads.
  </p><p>
	The ideal mode of operation is dual channel DMA mode. Here the
	kernel driver will configure the board for DMA in both directions.
	The driver also handles ISA DMA issues such as controller
	programming and the memory range limit for you. This mode is
	activated by calling the <code class="function">z8530_sync_dma_open</code>
	function. On failure a non zero error value is returned.
	Once this mode is activated it can be shut down by calling the
	<code class="function">z8530_sync_dma_close</code>. You must call the close
	function matching the open mode you used.
  </p><p>
	The final supported mode uses a single DMA channel to drive the
	transmit side. As the Z85C30 has a larger FIFO on the receive
	channel	this tends to increase the maximum speed a little. 
	This is activated by calling the <code class="function">z8530_sync_txdma_open
	</code>. This returns a non zero error code on failure. The
	<code class="function">z8530_sync_txdma_close</code> function closes down
	the Z8530 interface from this mode.
