      To get started on the topic, please read USB On-the-Go Basics (see
      Resources) which provides an introduction of USB OTG operation at
      the hardware level. A couple of wiki pages by Texas Instruments
      and Analog Devices also provide an overview of the Linux kernel
      MUSB configuration, albeit focused on some specific devices
      provided by these companies. Finally, getting acquainted with the
      USB specification at USB home page may come in handy, with
      practical instance provided through the Writing USB Device Drivers
      documentation (again, see Resources).

      Linux USB stack is a layered architecture in which the MUSB
      controller hardware sits at the lowest. The MUSB controller driver
      abstract the MUSB controller hardware to the Linux USB stack.

    </pre><p>
      As outlined above, the glue layer is actually the platform
      specific code sitting in between the controller driver and the
      controller hardware.
    </p><p>
      Just like a Linux USB driver needs to register itself with the
      Linux USB subsystem, the MUSB glue layer needs first to register
      itself with the MUSB controller driver. This will allow the
      controller driver to know about which device the glue layer
      supports and which functions to call when a supported device is
      detected or released; remember we are talking about an embedded
      controller chip here, so no insertion or removal at run-time.
    </p><p>
      All of this information is passed to the MUSB controller driver
      through a platform_driver structure defined in the glue layer as:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
static struct platform_driver jz4740_driver = {
	.probe		= jz4740_probe,
	.remove		= jz4740_remove,
	.driver		= {
		.name	= "musb-jz4740",
	},
};
    </pre><p>
      The probe and remove function pointers are called when a matching
      device is detected and, respectively, released. The name string
      describes the device supported by this glue layer. In the current
      case it matches a platform_device structure declared in
      arch/mips/jz4740/platform.c. Note that we are not using device
      tree bindings here.
    </p><p>
      In order to register itself to the controller driver, the glue
      layer goes through a few steps, basically allocating the
      controller hardware resources and initialising a couple of
      circuits. To do so, it needs to keep track of the information used
      throughout these steps. This is done by defining a private
      jz4740_glue structure:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
struct jz4740_glue {
	struct device           *dev;
	struct platform_device  *musb;
	struct clk		*clk;
};
    </pre><p>
      The dev and musb members are both device structure variables. The
      first one holds generic information about the device, since it's
      the basic device structure, and the latter holds information more
      closely related to the subsystem the device is registered to. The
      clk variable keeps information related to the device clock
      operation.
    </p><p>
      Let's go through the steps of the probe function that leads the
      glue layer to register itself to the controller driver.
    </p><p>
      N.B.: For the sake of readability each function will be split in
      logical parts, each part being shown as if it was independent from
      the others.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
static int jz4740_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
	struct platform_device		*musb;
	struct jz4740_glue		*glue;
	struct clk                      *clk;
	int				ret;

	glue = devm_kzalloc(&amp;pdev-&gt;dev, sizeof(*glue), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!glue)
		return -ENOMEM;

	musb = platform_device_alloc("musb-hdrc", PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO);
	if (!musb) {
		dev_err(&amp;pdev-&gt;dev, "failed to allocate musb device\n");
		return -ENOMEM;
	}

	clk = devm_clk_get(&amp;pdev-&gt;dev, "udc");
	if (IS_ERR(clk)) {
		dev_err(&amp;pdev-&gt;dev, "failed to get clock\n");
		ret = PTR_ERR(clk);
		goto err_platform_device_put;
	}

	ret = clk_prepare_enable(clk);
	if (ret) {
		dev_err(&amp;pdev-&gt;dev, "failed to enable clock\n");
		goto err_platform_device_put;
	}

	musb-&gt;dev.parent		= &amp;pdev-&gt;dev;

	glue-&gt;dev			= &amp;pdev-&gt;dev;
	glue-&gt;musb			= musb;
	glue-&gt;clk			= clk;

	return 0;

err_platform_device_put:
	platform_device_put(musb);
	return ret;
}
    </pre><p>
      The first few lines of the probe function allocate and assign the
      glue, musb and clk variables. The GFP_KERNEL flag (line 8) allows
      the allocation process to sleep and wait for memory, thus being
      usable in a blocking situation. The PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO flag (line
      12) allows automatic allocation and management of device IDs in
      order to avoid device namespace collisions with explicit IDs. With
      devm_clk_get() (line 18) the glue layer allocates the clock -- the
      <code class="literal">devm_</code> prefix indicates that clk_get() is
      managed: it automatically frees the allocated clock resource data
      when the device is released -- and enable it.
    </p><p>
      Then comes the registration steps:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
static int jz4740_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
	struct musb_hdrc_platform_data	*pdata = &amp;jz4740_musb_platform_data;

	pdata-&gt;platform_ops		= &amp;jz4740_musb_ops;

	platform_set_drvdata(pdev, glue);

	ret = platform_device_add_resources(musb, pdev-&gt;resource,
					    pdev-&gt;num_resources);
	if (ret) {
		dev_err(&amp;pdev-&gt;dev, "failed to add resources\n");
		goto err_clk_disable;
	}

	ret = platform_device_add_data(musb, pdata, sizeof(*pdata));
	if (ret) {
		dev_err(&amp;pdev-&gt;dev, "failed to add platform_data\n");
		goto err_clk_disable;
	}

	return 0;

err_clk_disable:
	clk_disable_unprepare(clk);
err_platform_device_put:
	platform_device_put(musb);
	return ret;
}
    </pre><p>
      The first step is to pass the device data privately held by the
      glue layer on to the controller driver through
      platform_set_drvdata() (line 7). Next is passing on the device
      resources information, also privately held at that point, through
      platform_device_add_resources() (line 9).
    </p><p>
      Finally comes passing on the platform specific data to the
      controller driver (line 16). Platform data will be discussed in
      <a class="link" href="device-platform-data.html" title="Chapter 4. Device Platform Data">Chapter 4</a>, but here
      we are looking at the platform_ops function pointer (line 5) in
      musb_hdrc_platform_data structure (line 3).  This function
      pointer allows the MUSB controller driver to know which function
      to call for device operation:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
static const struct musb_platform_ops jz4740_musb_ops = {
	.init		= jz4740_musb_init,
	.exit		= jz4740_musb_exit,
};
    </pre><p>
      Here we have the minimal case where only init and exit functions
      are called by the controller driver when needed. Fact is the
      JZ4740 MUSB controller is a basic controller, lacking some
      features found in other controllers, otherwise we may also have
      pointers to a few other functions like a power management function
      or a function to switch between OTG and non-OTG modes, for
      instance.
    </p><p>
      At that point of the registration process, the controller driver
      actually calls the init function:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
static int jz4740_musb_init(struct musb *musb)
{
	musb-&gt;xceiv = usb_get_phy(USB_PHY_TYPE_USB2);
	if (!musb-&gt;xceiv) {
		pr_err("HS UDC: no transceiver configured\n");
		return -ENODEV;
	}

	/* Silicon does not implement ConfigData register.
	 * Set dyn_fifo to avoid reading EP config from hardware.
	 */
	musb-&gt;dyn_fifo = true;

	musb-&gt;isr = jz4740_musb_interrupt;

	return 0;
}
    </pre><p>
      The goal of jz4740_musb_init() is to get hold of the transceiver
      driver data of the MUSB controller hardware and pass it on to the
      MUSB controller driver, as usual. The transceiver is the circuitry
      inside the controller hardware responsible for sending/receiving
      the USB data. Since it is an implementation of the physical layer
      of the OSI model, the transceiver is also referred to as PHY.
    </p><p>
      Getting hold of the MUSB PHY driver data is done with
      usb_get_phy() which returns a pointer to the structure
      containing the driver instance data. The next couple of
      instructions (line 12 and 14) are used as a quirk and to setup
      IRQ handling respectively. Quirks and IRQ handling will be
      discussed later in <a class="link" href="device-quirks.html" title="Chapter 5. Device Quirks">Chapter
      5</a> and <a class="link" href="handling-irqs.html" title="Chapter 3. Handling IRQs">Chapter 3</a>.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
static int jz4740_musb_exit(struct musb *musb)
{
	usb_put_phy(musb-&gt;xceiv);

	return 0;
}
    </pre><p>
      Acting as the counterpart of init, the exit function releases the
      MUSB PHY driver when the controller hardware itself is about to be
      released.
    </p><p>
      Again, note that init and exit are fairly simple in this case due
      to the basic set of features of the JZ4740 controller hardware.
      When writing an musb glue layer for a more complex controller
      hardware, you might need to take care of more processing in those
      two functions.
    </p><p>
      Returning from the init function, the MUSB controller driver jumps
      back into the probe function:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
static int jz4740_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
	ret = platform_device_add(musb);
	if (ret) {
		dev_err(&amp;pdev-&gt;dev, "failed to register musb device\n");
		goto err_clk_disable;
	}

	return 0;

err_clk_disable:
	clk_disable_unprepare(clk);
err_platform_device_put:
	platform_device_put(musb);
	return ret;
}
    </pre><p>
      This is the last part of the device registration process where the
      glue layer adds the controller hardware device to Linux kernel
      device hierarchy: at this stage, all known information about the
      device is passed on to the Linux USB core stack.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
static int jz4740_remove(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
	struct jz4740_glue	*glue = platform_get_drvdata(pdev);

	platform_device_unregister(glue-&gt;musb);
	clk_disable_unprepare(glue-&gt;clk);

	return 0;
}
    </pre><p>
      Acting as the counterpart of probe, the remove function unregister
      the MUSB controller hardware (line 5) and disable the clock (line
      6), allowing it to be gated.
