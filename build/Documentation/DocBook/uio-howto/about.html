	Each UIO device is accessed through a device file and several
	sysfs attribute files. The device file will be called
	<code class="filename">/dev/uio0</code> for the first device, and
	<code class="filename">/dev/uio1</code>, <code class="filename">/dev/uio2</code>
	and so on for subsequent devices.
	</p><p><code class="filename">/dev/uioX</code> is used to access the
	address space of the card. Just use
	<code class="function">mmap()</code> to access registers or RAM
	locations of your card.
	</p><p>
	Interrupts are handled by reading from
	<code class="filename">/dev/uioX</code>. A blocking
	<code class="function">read()</code> from
	<code class="filename">/dev/uioX</code> will return as soon as an
	interrupt occurs. You can also use
	<code class="function">select()</code> on
	<code class="filename">/dev/uioX</code> to wait for an interrupt. The
	integer value read from <code class="filename">/dev/uioX</code>
	represents the total interrupt count. You can use this number
	to figure out if you missed some interrupts.
	</p><p>
	For some hardware that has more than one interrupt source internally,
	but not separate IRQ mask and status registers, there might be
	situations where userspace cannot determine what the interrupt source
	was if the kernel handler disables them by writing to the chip's IRQ
	register. In such a case, the kernel has to disable the IRQ completely
	to leave the chip's register untouched. Now the userspace part can
	determine the cause of the interrupt, but it cannot re-enable
	interrupts. Another cornercase is chips where re-enabling interrupts
	is a read-modify-write operation to a combined IRQ status/acknowledge
	register. This would be racy if a new interrupt occurred
	simultaneously.
	</p><p>
	To address these problems, UIO also implements a write() function. It
	is normally not used and can be ignored for hardware that has only a
	single interrupt source or has separate IRQ mask and status registers.
	If you need it, however, a write to <code class="filename">/dev/uioX</code>
	will call the <code class="function">irqcontrol()</code> function implemented
	by the driver. You have to write a 32-bit value that is usually either
	0 or 1 to disable or enable interrupts. If a driver does not implement
	<code class="function">irqcontrol()</code>, <code class="function">write()</code> will
	return with <code class="varname">-ENOSYS</code>.
	</p><p>
	To handle interrupts properly, your custom kernel module can
	provide its own interrupt handler. It will automatically be
	called by the built-in handler.
	</p><p>
	For cards that don't generate interrupts but need to be
	polled, there is the possibility to set up a timer that
	triggers the interrupt handler at configurable time intervals.
	This interrupt simulation is done by calling
	<code class="function">uio_event_notify()</code>
	from the timer's event handler.
	</p><p>
	Each driver provides attributes that are used to read or write
	variables. These attributes are accessible through sysfs
	files.  A custom kernel driver module can add its own
	attributes to the device owned by the uio driver, but not added
	to the UIO device itself at this time.  This might change in the
	future if it would be found to be useful.
	</p><p>
	The following standard attributes are provided by the UIO
	framework:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	<code class="filename">name</code>: The name of your device. It is
	recommended to use the name of your kernel module for this.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	<code class="filename">version</code>: A version string defined by your
	driver. This allows the user space part of your driver to deal
	with different versions of the kernel module.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	<code class="filename">event</code>: The total number of interrupts
	handled by the driver since the last time the device node was
	read.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
	These attributes appear under the
	<code class="filename">/sys/class/uio/uioX</code> directory.  Please
	note that this directory might be a symlink, and not a real
	directory.  Any userspace code that accesses it must be able
	to handle this.
</p><p>
	Each UIO device can make one or more memory regions available for
	memory mapping. This is necessary because some industrial I/O cards
	require access to more than one PCI memory region in a driver.
</p><p>
	Each mapping has its own directory in sysfs, the first mapping
	appears as <code class="filename">/sys/class/uio/uioX/maps/map0/</code>.
	Subsequent mappings create directories <code class="filename">map1/</code>,
	<code class="filename">map2/</code>, and so on. These directories will only
	appear if the size of the mapping is not 0.
</p><p>
	Each <code class="filename">mapX/</code> directory contains four read-only files
	that show attributes of the memory:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	<code class="filename">name</code>: A string identifier for this mapping. This
	is optional, the string can be empty. Drivers can set this to make it
	easier for userspace to find the correct mapping.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	<code class="filename">addr</code>: The address of memory that can be mapped.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	<code class="filename">size</code>: The size, in bytes, of the memory
	pointed to by addr.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	<code class="filename">offset</code>: The offset, in bytes, that has to be
	added to the pointer returned by <code class="function">mmap()</code> to get
	to the actual device memory. This is important if the device's memory
	is not page aligned. Remember that pointers returned by
	<code class="function">mmap()</code> are always page aligned, so it is good
	style to always add this offset.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
	From userspace, the different mappings are distinguished by adjusting
	the <code class="varname">offset</code> parameter of the
	<code class="function">mmap()</code> call. To map the memory of mapping N, you
	have to use N times the page size as your offset:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
offset = N * getpagesize();
</pre><p>
	Sometimes there is hardware with memory-like regions that can not be
	mapped with the technique described here, but there are still ways to
	access them from userspace. The most common example are x86 ioports.
	On x86 systems, userspace can access these ioports using
	<code class="function">ioperm()</code>, <code class="function">iopl()</code>,
	<code class="function">inb()</code>, <code class="function">outb()</code>, and similar
	functions.
</p><p>
	Since these ioport regions can not be mapped, they will not appear under
	<code class="filename">/sys/class/uio/uioX/maps/</code> like the normal memory
	described above. Without information about the port regions a hardware
	has to offer, it becomes difficult for the userspace part of the
	driver to find out which ports belong to which UIO device.
</p><p>
	To address this situation, the new directory
	<code class="filename">/sys/class/uio/uioX/portio/</code> was added. It only
	exists if the driver wants to pass information about one or more port
	regions to userspace. If that is the case, subdirectories named
	<code class="filename">port0</code>, <code class="filename">port1</code>, and so on,
	will appear underneath
	<code class="filename">/sys/class/uio/uioX/portio/</code>.
</p><p>
	Each <code class="filename">portX/</code> directory contains four read-only
	files that show name, start, size, and type of the port region:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	<code class="filename">name</code>: A string identifier for this port region.
	The string is optional and can be empty. Drivers can set it to make it
	easier for userspace to find a certain port region.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	<code class="filename">start</code>: The first port of this region.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	<code class="filename">size</code>: The number of ports in this region.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	<code class="filename">porttype</code>: A string describing the type of port.
	</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="feedback.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="custom_kernel_module.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Feedback </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 3. Writing your own kernel module</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
