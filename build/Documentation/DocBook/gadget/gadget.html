(used primarily for testing and development with drivers
for usb controller hardware), other gadget drivers exist.
</p><p>There's an <span class="emphasis"><em>ethernet</em></span> gadget
driver, which implements one of the most useful
<span class="emphasis"><em>Communications Device Class</em></span> (CDC) models.  
One of the standards for cable modem interoperability even
specifies the use of this ethernet model as one of two
mandatory options.
Gadgets using this code look to a USB host as if they're
an Ethernet adapter.
It provides access to a network where the gadget's CPU is one host,
which could easily be bridging, routing, or firewalling
access to other networks.
Since some hardware can't fully implement the CDC Ethernet
requirements, this driver also implements a "good parts only"
subset of CDC Ethernet.
(That subset doesn't advertise itself as CDC Ethernet,
to avoid creating problems.)
</p><p>Support for Microsoft's <span class="emphasis"><em>RNDIS</em></span>
protocol has been contributed by Pengutronix and Auerswald GmbH.
This is like CDC Ethernet, but it runs on more slightly USB hardware
(but less than the CDC subset).
However, its main claim to fame is being able to connect directly to
recent versions of Windows, using drivers that Microsoft bundles
and supports, making it much simpler to network with Windows.
</p><p>There is also support for user mode gadget drivers,
using <span class="emphasis"><em>gadgetfs</em></span>.
This provides a <span class="emphasis"><em>User Mode API</em></span> that presents
each endpoint as a single file descriptor.  I/O is done using
normal <span class="emphasis"><em>read()</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>read()</em></span> calls.
Familiar tools like GDB and pthreads can be used to
develop and debug user mode drivers, so that once a robust
controller driver is available many applications for it
won't require new kernel mode software.
Linux 2.6 <span class="emphasis"><em>Async I/O (AIO)</em></span>
support is available, so that user mode software
can stream data with only slightly more overhead
than a kernel driver.
</p><p>There's a USB Mass Storage class driver, which provides
a different solution for interoperability with systems such
as MS-Windows and MacOS.
That <span class="emphasis"><em>Mass Storage</em></span> driver uses a
file or block device as backing store for a drive,
like the <code class="filename">loop</code> driver.
The USB host uses the BBB, CB, or CBI versions of the mass
storage class specification, using transparent SCSI commands
to access the data from the backing store.
</p><p>There's a "serial line" driver, useful for TTY style
operation over USB.
The latest version of that driver supports CDC ACM style
operation, like a USB modem, and so on most hardware it can
interoperate easily with MS-Windows.
One interesting use of that driver is in boot firmware (like a BIOS),
which can sometimes use that model with very small systems without
real serial lines.
</p><p>Support for other kinds of gadget is expected to
be developed and contributed
over time, as this driver framework evolves.
